delete:
  summary: Delete a checkpoint
  description: |
    This endpoint allows a developer to delete the checkpoint created in sandbox for a given ‘checkpointId’.
  
    Any checkpoint that has not been deleted by the developer will be automatically removed from database 7 days after its creation.

    **Note**: To prevent data loss or unexpected behaviour, the checkpoint restore should not be performed while other stateful checkpoint operations are in progress for the same National insurance number.
