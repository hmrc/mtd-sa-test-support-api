delete:
  summary: Delete a checkpoint
  description: |
    This endpoint enables you to delete a checkpoint created in the sandbox, specified with a ‘checkpointId’.
    
    Any checkpoint that is not deleted is automatically removed from the database 7 days after its creation.
    
    Checkpoints can only be deleted with this endpoint. Deleting data with the Delete Stateful Test Data endpoint will not delete checkpoints.
  
    **Note**: To prevent data loss or unexpected behaviour, the checkpoint delete should not be performed while other stateful checkpoint operations are in progress for the same National Insurance number.
