summary: Create a checkpoint
description: |
  This endpoint allows a developer to set up a checkpoint for the stateful data in the 
  sandbox environment for a particular National Insurance number. 
  A National Insurance number must be provided.
  
  The developer will be able to reset the data back to the checkpoint created using the 
  Restore to Checkpoint endpoint.

  *Note*: in order to prevent data loss or other unexpected behaviour, checkpoint creation 
  should not be performed while other stateful or checkpoint operations are in 
  progress for the same National Insurance number.
